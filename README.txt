A guide for those interested in tablet-based field data collection without intermediate to advanced coding skills in R, an introduction to the Open Data Kit (ODK).

ODK is an open-source set of software programs that enable the creation of simple surveys for free. It was originally designed jointly by Google and the University of Washington. It runs on Android devices.

See the HBEC website (http://www.eva.mpg.de/ecology/projects.html) for the hardware we are currently using for field data collection.

The document "Getting Started with ODK" will be your main source of orientation. Supporting documents will be referenced from this central document and are also available in this folder.
